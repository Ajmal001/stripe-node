If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer's discount.
       *
       * You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass a proration_date parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as the subscription_proration_date returned on the upcoming invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where period[start] is equal to the subscription_proration_date on the upcoming invoice resource.
